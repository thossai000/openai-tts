# OpenAI TTS Demo (Hypothetical Endpoint)

This repository contains a simple Python/Gradio application that demonstrates how one **might** call a hypothetical OpenAI Text-to-Speech (TTS) endpoint (`tts-1` or `tts-1-hd`) using a Gradio interface. Please note that **at the time of writing, OpenAI does not provide an official TTS endpoint** in their public API. The code provided is for demonstration and might require a private or future OpenAI TTS feature to work.

## Features

- **requests** for making HTTP requests.
- **pydub** for audio manipulation (converting MP3 to WAV in-memory).
- **gradio** for building a user-friendly web UI in Python.
- **openai** is imported to show how one might use a hypothetical `audio.speech` method.

## Installation

1. **Clone** or **download** this repository.
